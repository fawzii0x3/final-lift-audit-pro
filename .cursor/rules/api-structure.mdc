description: API calls must be declared in api folder and exported from index
globs: ["**/api/**/*", "**/modules/shared/api/**/*"]

- All API calls must be declared in the `modules/shared/api/` folder
- Each API service should have its own file (e.g., `technician.tsx`, `client.tsx`)
- All API functions must be exported from the main `modules/shared/api/index.ts` file
- If an API file doesn't exist, create it following the existing pattern
- API functions should be pure functions that return promises
- Use consistent naming: `getTechnicians`, `createClient`, `updateInspection`, etc.
- Import API functions from the index file: `import { getTechnicians } from '@/modules/shared/api'`
