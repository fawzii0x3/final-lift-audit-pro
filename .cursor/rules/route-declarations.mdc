# Route Declarations Rule

All application routes must be declared in the `modules/shared/routes/index.ts` file and used consistently throughout the application.

## Rules:
- All route paths must be defined in the `Routes` object in `modules/shared/routes/index.ts`
- Never use hardcoded route strings in components or router configuration
- Import routes using: `import { Routes } from "@modules/shared/routes"`
- Use the Routes object for all route references: `Routes.DASHBOARD`, `Routes.CLIENTS`, etc.
- When adding new routes, add them to the Routes object first, then use them in the router configuration
- Route constants should be in UPPER_CASE format
- Nested routes should be grouped under a parent object (e.g., `INSPECTIONS_NEW`)

## Examples:
✅ Correct:
```typescript
import { Routes } from "@modules/shared/routes";
// In router.tsx
path: Routes.DASHBOARD,
// In components
navigate(Routes.CLIENTS);
```

❌ Incorrect:
```typescript
// Hardcoded paths
path: "/dashboard",
navigate("/clients");
```
